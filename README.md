# Pattern Recognition project about olive oil

The file "FTIR_Spectra_olive_oils.csv" contains a collection of 120 Mid-infrared spectra collected from 60 different authenticated extra virgin olive oils, supplied to the Institute of Food Research, UK, by the International Olive Oil Council.

Spectra were acquired from each oil using attenuated total reflectance (ATR) sampling.  The acquisition order was randomized with respect to the country of origin code. 

Once all the samples had been examined once, a second acquisition session commenced, to produce a second spectrum from each sample.  Again the acquisition order was randomized with respect to country of origin.  thus, duplicate spectra were collected from all samples. 

The data are described in full in the journal paper "FTIR spectroscopy and multivariate analysis can distinguish the geographic origin of extra virgin olive oils" (Tapp H.S. et al, J. Agric. Food Chem. 51 (21) 6110-5 (2003)).
